# SSW322_Survey_System

Survey system between Matthew, Bowen, and Gleb for SSW322

(Okay so because there were to many files I couldn't just put the whole file in, but basically it should look like this
Survey -System
  Frontend
  package.json (smaller file)
  pachage-lock.json(smaller file)
  backend (put everything else in here, including the other .json files)
You will also eventually get a folder called node_modules in the backend too. Thats fine

Open the frontend with Live Server (e.g. in VS Code)

App runs locally at http://127.0.0.1:5500/frontend/index.html

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB locally
2. Start MongoDB (e.g. `mongod`)
3. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
